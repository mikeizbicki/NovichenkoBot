# NovichenkoBot ![](https://travis-ci.org/mikeizbicki/NovichenkoBot.png?branch=master)


FIXME: 
On 18 Nov, I noticed that the `USER_AGENT` parameter was incorrectly set to `Mozilla ...` rather than `NovichenkoBot`.  
This likely caused many websites with paywalls to return paywall error messages rather than displaying the content of their site.
This variable was probably set for at least 1-2 weeks, and so many urls likely need to be redownloaded.
